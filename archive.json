      "body": "It might simplify this spec (a lot) to say that all settings are remembered.  Right now, the settings that aren't marked as being memorable are those that simply don't apply during 0-RTT.  If we say that they could be remembered, then that would probably still work.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work reliably, it might mean saying that either:\r\n\r\n1. new settings need to consider their use in 0-RTT and provide guidance, such as this draft does for existing settings\r\n2. new settings that don't have considerations for use in 0-RTT can't be used in 0-RTT\r\n\r\nThis isn't perfect, because some settings might result in actions that clients need to follow in ways that would be incompatible.  For instance, a setting from a server that - once acknowledged - changed the format of any frames that follow SETTINGS+ACK, would not work.\r\n\r\nWe could finesse this and say that there is no SETTINGS+ACK for what has effectively become an initial value, so that the new format changes only apply once the client sends SETTINGS+ACK in response to the server connection preface, but that would not be in the spirit of the design here.  The design here says that remembered values are in effect; that is, they replace initial values.\r\n\r\nThis would have the effect of making it impossible to define a setting that adjusted core protocol elements without having first paid special attention to 0-RTT usage.  As we have no such extension, it's probably reasonable to consider that as a possibility, though I would be more comfortable if that change were in a core HTTP/2 revision rather than an offshoot extension doc like this one.",
